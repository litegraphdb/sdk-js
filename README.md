# JavaScript SDK for LiteGraph

Lightweight graph database with relational and vector support built using Sqlite, designed to power knowledge and artificial intelligence persistence and retrieval.

## Development Environment setup

- Node.js v18.20.4
- npm

Use the command `npm i` to install dependencies and then `npm run build` to build the project.

## Linking the project locally (for development and testing)

To use the library locally without publishing to a remote npm registry, first install the dependencies with the command:

```shell
npm install
```

Next, [link](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/link) it globally in local system's npm with the following command:

```shell
npm link
```

To use the link you just defined in your project, switch to the directory you want to use your lite-graph from, and run:

```shell
npm link lite-graph
```

Finally, you need to build the sdk, use command:

```shell
npm run build
```

You can then import the SDK with either import or require based on the ES Module (esm) or CommonJS (cjs) project, as shown below:

```javascript
import sdk from 'lite-graph';
//or
var sdk = require('lite-graph');
```

## Documentation

Docs can be generated by running the following command:

```shell
npm run build:docs
```

and view the docs in the `doc.json` file.

## Usage Example

```js
import LiteGraphSdk from 'lite-graph';

const sdk = new LiteGraphSdk('http://localhost:8701/');
const graphGuid = 'example-graph-guid';

// Create a new graph
sdk.createGraph('graph-guid', 'MyGraph').then((graph) => {
  console.log('Created graph:', graph);
});
```
